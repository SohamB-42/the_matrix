# escaping\_the\_matrix ðŸ’Š

A browser-based puzzle game where you are the anomaly destined to save a collapsing digital world. Can you find the master key before the system deletes itself... and you along with it?

## About The Project

You are the "Detective," a unique user within a simulated reality known as the Matrix. A mysterious "Voice" contacts you with a critical warning: the system is on the verge of total collapse due to a fatal anomaly. You are the only one who can perceive the glitches in the code, and therefore, the only one who can fix it.

This game is an interactive puzzle experience that challenges players to think outside the box, investigate their environment, and piece together clues to prevent a system-wide crash.

## How to Play

Your objective is to accept the mission and dive into the main terminal. Once there, your goal is to locate the **four fragments** of a master key needed to stabilize the system.

Interact with the terminal, look for clues in unexpected places, and pay attention to everything the Voice tells you. Once all four fragments are collected, combine them in the correct order to win the game. But be carefulâ€”some actions have consequences, and too many mistakes can lead to a permanent game over.

### The Four Fragments

  * **Part 1 (ZX12):** Found by hovering your mouse over a specific text element in the main terminal UI.
  * **Part 2 (QW34):** Found by discovering and using a hidden command to access a secret console page.
  * **Part 3 (MN78):** Found by opening the browser's developer tools and inspecting the game's `style.css` file.
  * **Part 4 (AB56):** After making three incorrect commands in the terminal, you are redirected to a corrupted 404 page. On this page, you must solve an interactive puzzle by typing the word **STABILIZE**. You have three attempts.

### The Final Key

After collecting all four fragments, enter the full key into the terminal:
`ZX12-QW34-MN78-AB56`
