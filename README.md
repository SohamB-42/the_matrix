A minimal, browser-based puzzle game about a choice. Are you a bug, or are you a feature?

-----

### Synopsis

The world you know is a simulation, and it's breaking. You are the **Detective**, an anomaly with the unique ability to perceive the glitches in the system's code. A mysterious entity contacts you with an offer.

This is your definitive choice:

  * Take the **Blue Pill**: Return to blissful ignorance. The connection is severed. **Game Over.**
  * Take the **Red Pill**: Accept the truth and your mission. You are taken to the system's core terminal to begin your work.

Your goal is to find the **four fragments** of a master key to repair the critical anomaly. The clues are hidden not just in the terminal, but in the very fabric of the game's code. Fail, and the system—along with you—will be permanently deleted.

### Features

  * 💊 **Iconic Choice**: The Red Pill / Blue Pill dilemma determines your path from the very beginning.
  * 💻 **Terminal Interface**: A retro-inspired console is your window into the code of the Matrix.
  * 🧩 **Multi-Layered Puzzles**: Investigate hidden commands, inspect source code, and survive system corruption events.
  * 🎬 **Multiple Endings**: Succeed and be welcomed to the "real world," or fail and have your connection permanently lost.
