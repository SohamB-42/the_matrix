The Setup: 
The Anomaly

The game begins with the player being contacted by a mysterious "Voice". This entity reveals that the player's world is a simulation called the Matrix, which is on the verge of collapse due to a critical anomaly. The player, referred to as the "Detective," is told they are the only one with the unique ability to see the system's flaws and fix the problem.


The Choice: 
Red Pill or Blue Pill
The player is then presented with a definitive choice:

1.Take the Blue Pill: This is the "failure" path. The player chooses ignorance, their connection is severed, and they are taken to the Game Over screen.
2.Take the Red Pill: This is the "success" path. The player accepts the mission and is taken to the main terminal to begin their investigation.


The Mission:
The Four Fragments
Once in the terminal, the player's goal is to find a four-part master key to fix the anomaly. Each part is a separate puzzle:



SPOILERS AHEAD:

i>Part 1 (ZX12): Found by hovering over a specific text element in the terminal.

ii>Part 2 (QW34): Found by using the hidden command to access a secret console page.

iii>Part 3 (MN78): Found by inspecting the game's style.css file.

iv>Part 4 (AB56): After making three incorrect commands in the terminal, the player is sent to a "corrupted" 404 page. Here, they must solve an interactive puzzle by typing the word STABILIZE. They have three attempts at this puzzle before it also triggers a Game Over.



The Climax & Endings:
After collecting all four fragments, the player must return to the terminal and enter the full key (ZX12-QW34-MN78-AB56).

Success: If the key is correct, the anomaly is fixed, and the player is redirected to the Success screen, welcoming them to the "real world."

Failure: If the player chooses the blue pill or fails the 404 puzzle, they are sent to the Game Over screen, where their connection is permanently lost.
